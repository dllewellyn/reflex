<!-- MANUAL ADDITIONS START -->
# Code generation 

A number of code-generation tools are available in the makefile - ensure that you check the makefile and run generate as part of / before a build for schemas and openapi -> code generation. 

When developing, you should also follow this pattern.

# Terraform

Infrastructure is managed using Terraform. It is stored in the `terraform` directory.

Ensure that as part of any plans and tasks there is a view of the required terraform infrastructure changes.

# Make tools 

* make tools command installs all the required tools like oapi-codegen

# Deployment

* Builds use cloudbuild.yaml and are triggered to automatically build and deploy when code is pushed to the repository main branch 

# Linting 

* Ensure that you run `make lint-go` as part of your development process and resolve the issues
